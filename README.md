Better Than Wolves was a total conversion mod of Minecraft version 1.5.2 created by FlowerChild.
Its intention was to introduce numerous items and mechanics into Minecraft to give it both
new variety and new challenges. As of April 9th 2021, the mod and all its code has been [released](http://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=9863&p=158404)
